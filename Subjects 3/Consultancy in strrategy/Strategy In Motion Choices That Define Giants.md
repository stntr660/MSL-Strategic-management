## Core Lessons (The Five Beliefs)

## 1. Master the Rules

- Correctly define the business: avoid too broad or too narrow definitions.
    
- Business boundaries are **discovered**, not just defined—through cost, capabilities, and customer sharing.
    
- Market leaders capture most economic value. Aim to **lead or differentiate** sharply to avoid complacency.
    

## 2. Leadership Economics

- Leaders gain superior profits and reinvest to sustain advantages.
    
- Avoid "satisfactory underperformance" traps by continuously pushing to maximize potential.
    

## 3. Profit Pools Shift

- Map current profit pools by value chain segment.
    
- Model how profit pools may evolve using scenario and curve analyses.
    
- Make bold bets alongside no-regrets moves, and maintain adaptability.
    

## 4. Customer Focus

- Understand customer segments, profitability drivers, and loyalty dynamics.
    
- Build **customer intimacy at scale** through culture, routines, and technology.
    
- Loyalty is to increase tenure and share-of-wallet, not exclusivity.
    

## 5. Strategy Is Action

- Strategy and execution are inseparable.
    
- Growth creates complexity; strategy must address the operating model to maintain speed and efficiency.
    
- Use hypothesis-driven approaches with **pilots, learning, and iteration** to accelerate execution readiness.
