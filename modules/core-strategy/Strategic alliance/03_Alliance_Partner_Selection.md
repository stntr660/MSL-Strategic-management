    J --> N[Cultural Fit]
    J --> O[Human Fit]
```

### Theoretical Distinction

**Two Fundamental Concepts**:
1. **Resource Complementarity** (Type I Diversity) - *Rationale for alliance formation*
2. **Partner Compatibility** (Type II Diversity) - *Enabler of alliance effectiveness*

## 3.2 Resource Complementarity

### Definition and Strategic Logic

> **Resource Complementarity**: The extent to which the joint use of distinct sets of resources yields a higher total return than the sum of returns earned if each set of resources were used independently.

**Mathematical Representation**:
```
Synergy = R(A+B) > R(A) + R(B)
Where: R = Return, A = Partner A Resources, B = Partner B Resources
```

### Value Creation Mechanisms

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Resource Complementarity] --> B[Additive Value]
    A --> C[Multiplicative Value]
    A --> D[Emergent Value]
    
    B --> B1[1 + 1 = 2]
    B --> B2[Combined capabilities]
    
    C --> C1[1 + 1 = 3]
    C --> C2[Synergistic effects]
    
    D --> D1[1 + 1 = X]
    D --> D2[Novel innovations]
```

### Resource Complementarity Types

#### 1. Market-Based Complementarity
