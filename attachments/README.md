# Attachments Folder

This folder stores all files, images, and documents attached to your Obsidian notes.

## Usage
- **Drag and drop files** directly into Obsidian notes
- **Files are automatically saved** to this folder
- **Link to attachments** using standard markdown: `![Image](attachments/filename.png)`

## File Organization
Keep files organized with descriptive names:
- `2024-Q2-Budget-Chart.xlsx`
- `Strategic-Plan-Diagram.png`
- `Meeting-Presentation-Nov-2024.pdf`

## Supported File Types
- **Images:** PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG
- **Documents:** PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX
- **Other:** Any file type (within repository size limits)

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive filenames
- Include dates when relevant
- Keep file sizes reasonable (<10MB per file)
- Remove unused files periodically

## Git Considerations
- All files in this folder will be committed to Git
- Large files may slow down repository operations
- Consider external storage for very large files (>50MB)
