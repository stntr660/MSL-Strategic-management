## Key Strategic Themes

## 1. Strategy is About Making Choices

- Strategy requires clear answers to five questions:
    
    1. What is our winning aspiration?
        
    2. Where will we play (markets, segments)?
        
    3. How will we win (competitive advantage)?
        
    4. What capabilities must we build?
        
    5. What management systems support these capabilities?
        
- For P&G, this meant focusing on fewer industries (household care, personal care, beauty care) and divesting others (e.g., food and beverage like Pringles).
    
- Strategic choices had to be made at both corporate and individual business unit levels.

## 2. The Importance of Business Definition

- Correct business definition is vital: too broad leads to overreach, too narrow misses growth, scale, and leverage.
    
- Lafley’s team “discovered” that P&G’s core was in branded consumer products with global scale and innovation potential, not slower-growing, more local commodity businesses like snacks.

## 3. Strategy Involves Judgement and Data

- Data and analytics are critical but insufficient on their own; strategic judgment is paramount.
    
- Strategy involves logical theories about customer behavior, competition, and market trends that need testing and iteration.
    
- For example, a failed product was the natural fruit and vegetable wash which had strong logic and some data but failed because consumer habits and retailer support were not aligned.

## 4. Strategy and Execution Are Inseparable

- “How to win” includes execution aspects like operations, marketing, and partnerships.
    
- Example: In a joint venture with Clorox, P&G converted a commodity industry into a differentiated product market, stressing strategic innovation and collaboration even with fierce competitors.
    
- Strategy must be simple to communicate (e.g., “the consumer is boss,” “first moment of truth”).

## 5. Leadership and Culture Enable Strategy

- Lafley emphasized engaging the entire team, communicating a clear, inspiring vision, and cascading strategy throughout the organization to build ownership and motivation.
    
- Managing a global, diverse company required evolving from “managing by walking around” to remote engagement, yet still maintaining consumer-first focus through direct observations.
    
- Clear strategy improved employee engagement, creativity, and teamwork.

## 6. Adaptation to Digital and Complexity

- The rise of digital channels created new “where to play” and “how to win” choices, adding complexity and opportunity.
    
- Online consumer testing and multi-channel marketing expanded strategic options.

## 7. Balanced Portfolio of Businesses and Investments

- Divesting less strategic assets funded investment in core, high-growth categories (e.g., acquiring Gillette, focusing on China market).
    
- Strategy includes prioritizing geographies, consumer segments, and product categories.

## 8. Lessons on Avoiding Common Pitfalls

- Focus groups can mislead; deeper ethnographic and qualitative methods offer better consumer understanding.
    
- Strategy is a dynamic “Rubiks Cube” that requires persistence, continuous adjustment, and involvement from business leaders.
    
- A strong strategic management capability within business units is essential to successfully make and execute choices.
