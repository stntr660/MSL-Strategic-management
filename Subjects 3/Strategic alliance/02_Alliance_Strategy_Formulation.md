## 2.2 Governance Mode Rationales: Seven Theoretical Perspectives

### 2.2.1 Transaction Cost Economics (TCE)

#### Core Logic
**Premise**: Organizations choose governance modes that minimize transaction costs

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Transaction Characteristics] --> B[Asset Specificity]
    A --> C[Uncertainty]
    A --> D[Frequency]
    
    B --> E[High] --> F[Hierarchy/Alliance]
    B --> G[Low] --> H[Market]
    
    C --> I[High] --> J[Alliance/Hierarchy]
    C --> K[Low] --> L[Market]
    
    D --> M[High] --> N[Alliance/Hierarchy]
    D --> O[Low] --> P[Market]
```

#### Key Assumptions
1. **Opportunism**: Self-interested, deceptive behavior potential
2. **Bounded Rationality**: Limited cognitive capacity for complex planning

#### Exchange Conditions
- **Asset Specificity**: Relationship-specific investments
- **Uncertainty**: Unpredictable consequences
- **Frequency**: Number of repeated exchanges

#### Alliance Implications
- **Moderate Asset Specificity**: Alliances preferred over pure market/hierarchy
- **Relational Governance**: Trust reduces transaction costs
- **Safeguarding Mechanisms**: Contracts and monitoring systems

#### Empirical Evidence and Limitations
**Supporting Evidence**:
- Alliance design aligned with TCE predictions improves performance
- Asset specificity influences governance mode selection

**Limitations**:
- Limited empirical support for complete TCE predictions
- Underestimates role of trust and relational governance
- Static perspective on governance evolution

### 2.2.2 Resource-Based View (RBV)

#### Core Logic
**Premise**: Firms seek optimal resource boundaries to maximize competitive advantage

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Resource Characteristics] --> B[Valuable]
    A --> C[Rare]
    A --> D[Inimitable]
    A --> E[Non-substitutable]
    
    F[VRIN Resources] --> G[Competitive Advantage]
    G --> H[Governance Mode Selection]
    
    I[Resource Mobility] --> J[High] --> K[Market Exchange]
    I --> L[Low] --> M[Alliance/M&A]
```

#### Alliance Formation Logic
1. **Resource Complementarity**: Accessing external capabilities
2. **Resource Leverage**: Combining resources for synergy
3. **Resource Learning**: Acquiring new capabilities
4. **Resource Preservation**: Maintaining competitive advantage

#### Resource Configurations
- **Complementary Alignment**: Dissimilar but synergistic resources
- **Supplementary Alignment**: Similar resources for scale/scope
- **Resource Under-performance**: Misaligned or ineffective combinations

#### Limitations
- **Limited empirical testing** of resource impact on governance
- **Cost neglect**: Focus on possession vs. deployment costs
- **Static perspective**: Insufficient attention to resource evolution

### 2.2.3 Resource Dependence Perspective (RDP)

#### Core Logic
**Premise**: Firms manage external dependencies through governance mode selection

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[External Dependencies] --> B[Resource Importance]
    A --> C[Resource Scarcity]
    A --> D[Control Discretion]
    
    E[High Dependence] --> F[Alliance/M&A]
    G[Low Dependence] --> H[Market Exchange]
    
    I[Power Imbalance] --> J[Dependence Reduction Strategies]
    J --> K[Diversification]
    J --> L[Alliance Networks]
    J --> M[Vertical Integration]
```

#### Power and Dependence Dynamics
- **Resource Importance**: Criticality for firm survival
- **Resource Scarcity**: Availability and substitutability
- **Discretion**: Control over resource allocation and use

#### Alliance Implications
