## Key Idea

Roger Martin argues that **strategic planning**—a term often used in business—is actually a **misnomer**, because it mixes two very different concepts: **planning** and **strategy**. Most companies call their annual list of initiatives a “strategy,” but in reality, they are just making **plans**—comfortable, internally controlled actions without a winning logic.

## The Difference Between Planning and Strategy

|Aspect|Planning|Strategy|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|A list of actions or resource allocations the company intends to complete.|A coherent set of choices designed to achieve a specific, winning position in a chosen field.|
|**Focus**|What the organization will _do_ (e.g., build a plant, hire staff, launch a product).|Where and how the organization will _win_ in the market.|
|**Control**|Internal and within the company’s control (costs, resources, schedules).|External and dependent on customer response, competition, and market factors.|
|**Nature**|Comforting, safe, focused on execution and internal goals.|Risky, uncertain, and based on a theory about how to succeed competitively.|
|**Outcome**|Often leads to participation (“playing to play”).|Aims to achieve competitive advantage (“playing to win”).|

## Martin’s Definition of Strategy

A **strategy** is an **integrated set of choices** that positions an organization on a chosen playing field **to win**.  
It requires:

1. A **theory of success**—why this field and how to win there.
    
2. **Coherence**—all choices and actions must fit together logically.
    
3. **Translation into action**—clear, doable activities derived from the theory.
    

In contrast, **planning** can just be a disconnected list of departmental goals that lack this coherence.

## Example: Southwest Airlines

Traditional airlines used “hub-and-spoke” models and focused on routes, costs, and expansions—classic **planning**.  
Southwest Airlines, however, had a **strategy** with a theory of competitive advantage:

- Compete not with other airlines, but with Greyhound (bus travel).
    
- Offer cheap, convenient, short-haul flights as a better alternative.
    
- Use one aircraft type (Boeing 737) to simplify operations.
    
- Use point-to-point routes to reduce downtime.
    
- Eliminate unnecessary services to reduce costs.
    

These interconnected choices formed a **coherent theory for winning**—leading to massive success while others simply “planned.”

## Why Managers Prefer Planning

Planning feels safe and controllable:

- Managers can decide on budgets, headcounts, or expansions.
    
- These are internal decisions with predictable results.
    

Strategy, by contrast, involves **customers and competitors**, which are unpredictable. Managers must **bet on a theory**—what customers will value and how the company can serve them better. This introduces uncertainty and anxiety, but it is the only path to true competitive success.

## Escaping the “Comfort Trap”

To move from planning to real strategy:

1. **Accept uncertainty**—You cannot prove success in advance. Strategy involves belief and testing.
    
2. **Articulate your logic**—Clearly lay out what must be true for the strategy to work (about customers, competitors, and resources).
    
3. **Monitor and adapt**—Observe whether these assumptions hold. Adjust the strategy as reality unfolds.
    
4. **Keep it simple**—Summarize on one page:
    
    - Where we will play.
        
    - How we will win.
        
    - Capabilities required.
        
    - Management systems in place.
        
    - Why this will achieve our aspiration.

## Core Lesson for Consultants

When advising a business, distinguish between:

- **Plans** (activities) – “What will you do?”
    
- **Strategy** (choices) – “Where and how will you win?”
    

A consultant’s role is to push clients to move beyond comfort-driven activity planning toward creating **a coherent theory of competitive advantage** that can evolve through learning.
