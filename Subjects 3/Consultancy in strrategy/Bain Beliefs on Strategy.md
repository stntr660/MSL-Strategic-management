We live in a world of constant turbulence and yet the fundamentals of strategy endure. The context changes, but the concepts remain the same. If you are feeling a little overwhelmed—as many of our clients are—now may be the right time to re-ground yourself in the enduring principles of strategy. 

Strategy is a big, broad topic and we won’t pretend that these five beliefs are all you need to know to call yourself a strategist. But these themes guide [our strategy work](https://www.bain.com/consulting-services/strategy/) and the clients who achieve the kind of results we aspire to achieve live by them, just as we do.

Among top revenue earners, few companies meet our definition of sustained value creation for 10 years in a row. Our definition has two parts: net profits that exceed cost of capital (also called economic value added) and real top-line growth (net revenue growth that exceeds global inflation). Just 10% of companies were able to achieve this in 8 out of 10 years.

Sustainable, profitable growth is hard. Here’s what it demands.

### 1. You can’t win unless you master the rules of the game

Every game is different, and every game has its own rules.

The very first rule—the most fundamental and the most often abused—is business definition.

How many times have you heard a company say, “We’re not in the X business (where X is something profitable, stable, and dull), we’re in the Y business (where Y is something new, growthy, and exciting).”

“We’re not in the ball bearings business; we’re in the global frictionless mobility solutions business.” Says who?

The limits of a properly defined business are demarcated by the places where economic leverage begins and ends.

Define a business too broadly and you will assume that you have the ability to compete in places where you will, in fact, get crushed; define it too narrowly and you will miss out not only on opportunities for profit, but also opportunities to gain scale and other forms of leverage that are critical to your business.

That’s why we sometimes say that business boundaries are discovered, not defined; you discover where they are when you run into them, the way Wile E. Coyote belatedly discovers the laws of gravity shortly after he runs off a cliff.

Correct business definition comes from understanding both the scope and the limits of cost, capability, and customer sharing between products and market segments.

Here’s our favorite example: outboard motors. You may have seen this before, but there’s no harm in a refresher. In a correctly defined business, there is generally a strong relationship between relative market share and profitability. But take a look at this:

Why is the relationship broken here?

Because an outboard motor is just one kind of small motor. OMC originally stood for Outboard Motor Company—that’s all they did. Yamaha makes many different kinds of small motors, including for motorbikes and lawnmowers. That allowed Yamaha to move down the experience curve of small motor manufacturing much faster than OMC, lowering their manufacturing costs and increasing their margins.

The correct business definition in this case was not outboard motors, but small motors. Once you account for that, the picture makes sense.

Decades later, Netflix pulled off one of the most successful corporate reinventions ever when they successfully pivoted from the physical distribution of DVDs to the production and distribution of digital content, but not before they nearly snatched defeat from the jaws of victory by misunderstanding the basics of business definition.

The costs and capabilities of the two activities were, indeed, different, but the customer sharing turned out to be almost complete.

The right answer was not to split the company, but rather to have one face to the customer and two operationally distinct supply chains—one focused on the logistics of distributing physical DVDs and the other focused on the production and distribution of digital content. After losing 1 million subscribers and about two-thirds of their market cap, they were forced to reverse course.

We should note in passing that business definitions can evolve over time because markets, customers, competitors, regulations, and technology all keep moving.

The critical takeaway here is that getting the business definition right is foundational to good strategy. Without it you cannot meaningfully discuss the concepts that follow.

### 2. Leadership economics are worth fighting for

A hallmark of correctly defined businesses is that the leader in those businesses has superior economics. Our analysis of 320 companies across 45 markets worldwide shows that in most correctly defined markets, one or two players capture 80% of the economic profit.
![[Screenshot 2025-11-01 at 01.05.03.png]]
That’s why it’s good to be the leader. A market leader has the opportunity to reinvest their profits in order to extend their leadership and bolster the sustainability of their earnings into the future. Sometimes they can even use their superior resources to change the rules of the game to their advantage.

But leadership economics don’t accrue by default. This defines the paradox of leadership: The more strongly positioned a business is, the more likely it is to be operating below its full potential. Management teams must actively work to avoid the trap of “satisfactory underperformance.”

In most markets, the top two or three players capture all of the real economic value, leaving the rest with nothing. This means that if you are a follower the most fundamental strategic question you face is: Can we become the leader?

If there is a path to leadership, you have to take it; when you get there, you have to keep pushing. Don’t settle for being better when being the absolute best is within reach.

If there is no viable path to leadership, then you must either exploit the rules of the game (e.g., by finding a form of differentiation that overcomes your disadvantages of scale), or you must change the rules of the game (i.e., become a disrupter). There’s often good money to be made following these strategies, in part because so many leaders are complacent.

Let others work in service of satisfactory underperformance; at Bain, we believe strategy is about unlocking the path to full potential.

### 3. Profit pools don’t stand still, and neither should you

When asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton replied, “Because that’s where the money is.”

For similar reasons, all good strategy projects take the (often considerable) time and effort to do two things: 1) map the current state of the industry profit pool and 2) model out plausible scenarios showing how those profit pools may evolve over time.

Mapping the profit pool—the total economic profit earned at each step of the value chain—requires first that you get the business definition correct.

Figuring out how the profit pool might evolve requires the use of tools like e-curves and s-curves, which allow you to model many variables with a reasonable degree of confidence over the near-to-medium term and sometimes even longer.

Here’s an example—an oldie, but a goodie.

Kodak was not, as many believe, “blindsided” by the advent of digital photography; in fact, by doing e-curve analysis in the early 1990s, Kodak was able to more or less correctly predict the year in which digital photography would overtake traditional film.

Why they failed to act on this insight is a long story, one that hinges in part on culture and in part on the natural reluctance to cannibalize one’s own cash cow. Here’s a look at how the photography profit pool evolved from 1995 to 2005.
![[Screenshot 2025-11-01 at 01.05.10.png]]
Notice anything surprising? The profit pool actually got bigger after digital photography took over. The problem for Kodak was that the profit pool shifted from film manufacture and processing to memory cards.

In other words, the business definition changed; the relevant unit of experience went from millions of feet of film manufactured to millions of gigabytes of memory produced. That’s why SanDisk, which makes memory cards for a vast array of applications beyond photography, ended up making most of the money in the digital photography business.

What might cause a similar disruption in your industry? Think about the factors beyond your control that might impact your business over the next five years. To name just five: economic uncertainty, global conflict, trade disruptions, climate change, and AI.

In the face of turbulence, you have to model what you can using the tools at your disposal, then use scenarios and sensitivities to capture remaining uncertainty where it matters.

This will allow you to construct a resilient portfolio of choices: a core set of bold, no regrets moves that make sense under any scenario, plus a handful of bets that will pay off more or less depending on how the future unfolds.

In addition, you must recognize that if change is a constant, then adaptability is non-negotiable: Your strategy must provide enough clarity for the organization to execute while preserving the flexibility to anticipate and respond to changing circumstances.

### 4. When in doubt, focus on the customer

“Customer centricity” may be a widely over-used phrase, but it is nevertheless true that when companies turn inward, they generally start dying soon after.

By contrast, companies that truly focus on their best customers tend to thrive, so what, in practice, does that mean?

For one thing, it means understanding who your customers are, what they care about, what and why they buy from you, what and why they buy from your competitors instead, and what it’s going to take to get them to stay with you and to buy more. This is customer segmentation.

For another, it means understanding which of your customer segments generate the lion’s share of your profits. This is customer and product profitability.

Like profit pools, customers do not stand still; you need to monitor them closely and experiment constantly.

Earning the loyalty of your most profitable and fastest-growing customer segments is at the heart of customer strategy. For a concept so often discussed, loyalty is surprisingly often misunderstood.

The most common misunderstanding is to confuse loyalty for exclusivity. In everything from corn chips to cloud computing, customers tend to split their purchases more often than most companies realize.

The goal is not exclusivity but rather, put simply, to keep customers with you longer, to try to sell them a little more over time, and to encourage them to tell a friend about you. Ideally, we will delight them along the way, but for most businesses simply not alienating them would be a good start.

Fully mining the ever-evolving intersection of loyalty and profitability will keep most companies busy indefinitely.

In fact, the biggest challenge many businesses will face is maintaining their focus on the customer as they grow. Start-ups are customer centric as a matter of survival; great businesses invest in culture, routines and technology that allow them to achieve customer intimacy at scale.

### 5. Strategy is about making things happen

This last point is about execution.

(But I thought we were talking about strategy?) Sigh.

No one should ever talk about strategy and execution as though they are two separate concepts. Our own company, Bain, was founded on results, which means that we are not interested in intellectually elegant strategies that cannot be executed.

In our study of 426 companies executing major changes, only 12% achieved or exceeded the ambition they set, 68% settled for dilution of value and mediocre results, and 20% failed to deliver, producing less than 50% of the results they expected.

Everything in a strategy project, from the development of initial hypotheses through to the prioritization and resourcing of initiatives, must be done with the challenges of execution in mind.

There are many such challenges and just as many ways to overcome them. Let’s start with two of them: one focused on the “what” and the other focused on the “how.”

What does a strategy need to solve for? An inescapable reality of business is that growth begets complexity and complexity kills growth. Why? Because when complexity arises, bureaucracy is never far behind. Bureaucracy is the enemy of speed, and speed is essential to growth. Therefore, any growth strategy must address the company’s operating model.

In other words, the strategy can’t just answer the question, “Where are the greatest opportunities for profitable growth?” It must also answer the question, “How does this specific company pursue these opportunities in a way that is efficient, effective and repeatable?”

How do you go about creating a strategy with execution in mind? By breaking down the old “horizontal” approach to strategy development.

Once upon a time, consultants would spend weeks and months creating a fact base and debating its implications before turning their attention to mobilization. As a result, you might easily reach the end of a six-month strategy process with such blistering insights as “We must win in China.” 

We believe that one of the advantages of a hypothesis-driven approach to strategy is that it allows your executive team to quickly identify no regrets moves—things that are blindingly obvious you will need to do in order to be successful.

Instead of pursuing the fifth decimal point of accuracy on exactly why you must win in China, we think the right move is to collaborate with the China team to figure out exactly what that is going to take. And don’t do this in a theoretical way, do it by piloting things in the real world, testing and learning, iterating quickly, and figuring out what works and what doesn’t.

That way, in the time it takes your executive team to reach a conclusion about some of the more controversial or ambiguous choices, you already have a plan to win in China that is battle tested and ready to scale.

Suffice to say that we do not believe there is such a thing as a good strategy badly executed; there are good strategies well executed and then there’s ... whatever everybody else is working on.
