## Characteristics of McKinsey Presentations

- **Analytical and Data-Driven:** These presentations contain a lot of detailed analysis and data to support insights.
    
- **Clear Takeaway Titles:** Slide titles are often written as full sentences that convey a clear key message or conclusion.
    
- **Consistent Style:** They use standardized colors, fonts, layouts, and graphical elements such as kicker boxes for emphasis.
    
- **Use of Frameworks:** Complex ideas are simplified with frameworks like timelines, value chains, bubble charts, histograms, maturity models, waterfall charts, and return on equity (ROE) analysis.
    
- **Diverse Topics:** Range from topics like Big Data in Mining to global insurance trends and affordable housing challenges.
    
- **Blend of Quantitative and Qualitative Data:** Presentations incorporate expert opinions, quotes, and results from large surveys (sometimes with over 20,000 respondents) to reflect the “voice of the customer.”

## User Comments and Reflections

- Some users noted that many slides seem designed to stand alone and survive delivery even by an unskilled speaker, contrasting with approaches like Guy Kawasaki's 10-20-30 rule.
    
- Preference varies: some like slides that stand alone because they get circulated often; others prefer slides as verbal summaries supported by a detailed narrative.
    
- Some presentations appeared less polished, especially those from conferences or non-core consulting projects.
    
- Despite mixed aesthetic quality, the content and analytical depth were appreciated by readers.
    
- The author welcomes readers to share more online examples to expand the list.
